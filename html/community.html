            <span>An important part of NOVA’s long-range plan is to grow the sport of swimming. This goal is not only a cornerstone of NOVA’s mission, </span>
            <span>but it is also a primary tenet of USA Swimming. In order to do this, NOVA must have the facility resources to offer more to the community.</span>

            <span>By expanding our facility, NOVA will be able to expand programs which directly impact the Richmond community.  </span>
            <span>Additional facility resources will allow NOVA to:</span><br>
            <li>Serve more children through our robust lessons program</li>
            <li>Expand our outreach efforts to teach water safety and lessons to area children who would not otherwise be able to afford swim lessons</li>
            <li>Introduce or grow programs to serve those with disabilities</li>
            <li>Develop programs for the area’s older population, including the various centers within a few miles of the facility</li>
            <li>Create a better environment for lessons, outreach and serving the elderly with a warm water facility</li>
            <li>Investigate ways to partner with organizations offering rehabilitation services</li>
            <li>Allow for the expansion of Henrico County Public Schools High School swimming partnership</li>
