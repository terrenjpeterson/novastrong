          <p>
            <span>NOVA has made a difference in the lives of thousands since our founding in 1987.  From the mother wanting to ensure her preschool aged child is safe around the water, to the </span>
            <span>elite collegiate swimmer and Olympic hopeful, to the grandmother swimming for fitness, NOVA's programs touch Richmonders of all ages.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>As a non-profit organization, NOVA strives to meet the needs of our swimming families as well as those of the surrounding community.  We live our mission - <i>to develop </span>
            <span>excellence in swimmers of all ages and abilities by challenging and motivating them to reach their full potential in swimming and in life</i> - every day.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>To continue to serve our families and community, NOVA needs to expand.  An expansion of our facilities will result in an expansion of our programs and the number of people we can serve.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
