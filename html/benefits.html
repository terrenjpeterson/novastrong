            <h4>For the Competitive Youth Swim Team...</h4>
            <span>More space will have an immediate impact on our competitive youth team.  <b>NOVA is the only Top Twenty club in the country that does not have access to a 50M training </span>
            <span>facility.</b>  Having a long-course pool will allow our swimmers to train more effectively for the long-course season.  NOVA will be able to host long-course meets, </span>
            <span>relieving burdensome and expensive travel for our families.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>Perhaps more importantly, more lanes will mean less crowded practices for all team swimmers.  We will be able to evaluate practice times and shift them to be more ideal </span>
            <span>for our families.  We expect to be able to offer benefits to each of our training levels.  Please note that the potential improvements listed below are subject to change.</span>

            <h4>For Swimnova Lessons...</h4>
            <span>for the lessons program, NOVA will be able to offer more after school and evening options, making it more convenient for lessons </span>
            <span>families.  Families will have more classes from which to choose, and we will have less families who do not get their first </span>
            <span>choice of day/time.  Some possible benefits of expansion are listed here.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>

            <li>Expand class options to allow for more space in each level and facilitate progression through the program.</li>
            <li>Reduce dependencies on weekend lessons, which are often forced to skip weeks due to home meets, or be able to schedule lessons again during meets.</li>
            <li>Offer more employment opportunities for older swimmers to teach lessons.</li>
