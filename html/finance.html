          <p>
            <span>NOVA of Virginia Aquatics is a nonprofit, 501(c)3 organization.  Revenues come from dues and fees, grants, fundraising and community support.  NOVA's finances </span>
            <span>are audited each year; the latest statements are publicly available on <a href="http://giverichmond.guidestar.org/portrait/1048171/nova-virginia-aquatics.aspx">http://www.giverichmond.org</a>.</span><br>

            <span>NOVA is incredibly fortunate to be in a solid financial position, which will allow the club to embark on this expansion project.  NOVA programs generate sufficient </span>
            <span>cash to cover operating costs and meet the club's financial obligations.  NOVA's strong position will allow reinvestment in facilities, programs and staff, and, with </span>
            <span>the addition of capital campaign funding, expansion.  During the recent planning period, NOVA has been able to set aside some funds to support the project.</span><br>

            <span>The cost of the expansion of the NOVA Aquatics Center is currently estimated to be $6.75 - $7 million. NOVA's plan for </span>
            <span>funding the expansion is threefold: through borrowing, fundraising, and using club surpluses collected over the last few </span>
            <span>years. NOVA will raise as much of the funds as possible toward the project. Fundraising dollars will come from club families, </span>
            <span>major partners, philanthropic and corporate foundations, and business and community supporters. We will be able to move </span>
            <span>forward once a minimum of $2.0 million in gifts and pledges is secured. The balance will be covered by cash on hand and financing.</span>

            <span>Over the last two years and to be continued as the project progresses, NOVA has developed revenue streams which will allow the club to meet long-term obligations as well as cover </span>
            <span>operating costs of the new facility.  As the expansion is complete, expansion of current programming and the addition of new programming options will ensure NOVA's long-term financial security.</span>
