          <p>
            <span>In 2013, NOVA established a partnership with Bon Secours to bring its <i>movin’ mania</i> program to the West End of Richmond for the first time.  </span>
            <span>The <i>movin’ mania</i> program, designed to teach at-risk kids skills for healthy living, partnered with NOVA to offer free swim lessons to children who otherwise </span>
            <span>would not be able to learn to swim. 35 children participated in the first summer, and some of them have continued taking lessons throughout the year.  </span>
            <span>We will continue this program during the summer of 2015 as well.</span><br>
