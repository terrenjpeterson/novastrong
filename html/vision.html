          <p>
            <span>The expanded NOVA Aquatics Center will include the existing two pools and add an eight-lane, 50 meter by 25 yard, Olympic-sized, long-course pool.  When facing </span>
            <span>the current building, the pool will be located to the left side of the existing structure, at the back of the parking lot.  The current plan for the facility </span>
            <span>includes the pool, bleacher-style seating, new locker rooms, and a moveable bulkhead.  Detailed drawings can be seen <a href="drawings.html">here</a>.</span><br>
            <span></span><br> 
            <span>The addition of the new building will necessitate additional parking as well.  We are working with nearby landowners to secure additional parking space.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>The cost of the project is currently estimated at $6.75 million; click <a href="finance.html">here</a> to learn more about project finances.  </span>
            <span>The project cost will be covered by fundraising from individuals, businesses, and foundations, as well as bank loans and cash on hand.  </span>
            <span>We began fundraising efforts in late 2014, and our fundraising total currently stands at over $600,000.  </span>
            <span>To break ground, we need $2 million of the total cost of the project on hand.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>In August 2014, NOVA issued a Request for Proposal from local architectural firms.  The committee and board selected Moseley Architects </span>
            <span>in October 2014 to design the building.  We are confident that we have made the best choice for our needs.</span><br>
