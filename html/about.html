          <p>
            <span>NOVA of Virginia Aquatics is a nonprofit, parent-owned and –directed swim club located in the Richmond, Virginia area.  </span>
            <span>NOVA is a full-service swim club that meets the needs of every level ofswimmer, from lessons to Masters.  </span>
            <span>The club is currently ranked seventh in the nation for overall club performance for swimming competition and organization by USA Swimming.  </span>
            <span>We are recognized as a Gold Medal Club, one of just twenty in the country.</span>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>Led by head coach Geoff Brown, USA Swimming’s 2012 Developmental Coach of the Year, NOVA’s coaching staff has led its team </span>
            <span>to three NCSA Junior National Swimming Championships, won the Virginia Swimming Short Course </span>
            <span>Age Group Championship each year since 1999, and won the Virginia Swimming Senior Long Course Championship every year since 2006.  </span>
            <span>As a comprehensive aquatics center, NOVA has not only the number one team in Virginia Swimming, but also the region’s leading youth swim lessons program, </span>
            <span>teaching over 5,000 lessons each year, as well as the top Master’s swimming program in Virginia.</span>

            <span>The NOVA story begins in 1987, with the formation of the nonprofit club practicing in three locations.  The name was chosen to reflect the new energy that would come </span>
            <span>from the founding of a club with national aspirations.  Eventually, the three branches split, and NOVA in its current incarnation was born.  The club continued to practice </span>
            <span>in rented space from a number of years.  In 1997, the original NOVA Aquatics Center, which includes the current competition pool, was built through the diligent </span>
            <span>fundraising efforts of the board and swimming families.  In 2005, the second pool was added when the team grew and borrowed </span>
            <span> money to finance the project.</span>

          <p>
            <span>Our current facility includes two 10 lane, 25 yard pools for short course swimming, locker rooms, offices and the Virginia Swim Shop.  Since the beginning, NOVA has grown </span>
            <span>from 90 swimmers to 800.  Over time, the organization has also grown not only to serve those interested in our competitive youth swim team, but also adults interested </span>
            <span>in competitive and recreational swimming, children taking swim lessons, and more.  We currently serve almost 600 swim families and teach almost 5,000 swim lessons per </span>
            <span>year.  We have expanded our programs to suit virtually every swimmer's need</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>Growth over time has allowed NOVA to broaden its programs and fulfill its mission - <i>to develop excellence in swimmers of all ages and abilities by challenging and </span>
            <span>motivating them to reach their full potential in swimming and in life.</i></span>
