          <p>
            <span>The current NOVA Aquatics Center is unable to serve the needs of the club or the community. Our organization has grown tremendously over the last few years.  </span>
            <span>We have grown from ninety competitive team swimmers to over 800. We currently teach almost 5,000 individual </span>
            <span>lessons each year. And, our other programming has grown, both in scope and in numbers. Revenues have increased significantly </span>
            <span>in the major areas of the business - team revenue, lessons revenue, and swim shop revenue. Our explosive growth over the last few years means </span>
            <span><b>the facility is limiting our ability to execute our mission. </b></span>

            <span><b>Our desire to expand comes from two guiding principles: to provide a quality training environment to all of our NOVA swimmers, </span>
            <span>and to use our facility resources to meet the programming needs of the wider community. </b></span>
            <span>By expanding the NOVA Aquatics Center and gaining additional capacity, we will be able to further expand our offerings and our impact in the </span>
            <span>community, serving more swimmers of all ages and abilities and balancing the needs of the team with those of the community.</span>
