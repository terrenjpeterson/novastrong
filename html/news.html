    <p>
      <h4 class="featurette-heading">June 17, 2015</h4>
      <br>
      <span>Dear NOVA Family and Friends,</span><br>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row featurette">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>
      <span>Ten days ago I sat at my desk and typed out a campaign update acknowledging the </span>
      <span>extraordinary support we had received through June 10th, and wondered if we </span>
      <span>could rally to surpass our second major hurdle…$1,000,000. Tonight I am almost </span>
      <span>speechless. It has truly been an incredible ten days. We have received another </span>
      <span>$300,000 in donations from our NOVA family and friends, bringing that total to </span>
      <span>$1,125,000! That is $30,000 a day! Incredible. Thank you to all who contributed </span>
      <span>over the last week and a half.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Our Founders’ Club is now complete and listed <a href="donors.html">here</a>. We are humbled by the </span>
      <span>dedication and generosity of the first contributors and extend our sincere thanks for </span>
      <span>the financial support you have given for the pool expansion project.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>But there was another event – a milestone event – that occurred this week as well. It </span>
      <span>is our privilege to announce that The Sharp Foundation is honoring NOVA with a </span>
      <span>major gift of $500,000! This incredible gesture allows us to keep the project on track </span>
      <span>and provides us the extra momentum to continue our campaign efforts.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>On behalf of the NOVA Board and the Campaign Committee, I want to extend our </span>
      <span>deepest thanks and appreciation to the Sharp family for their support of our pool </span>
      <span>expansion initiative. This is our opportunity to strengthen the NOVA experience, </span>
      <span>bring the benefits of swimming to more children, and to make a bigger impact in the </span>
      <span>Richmond community. It would not be possible without this most generous </span>
      <span>contribution to our campaign.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>The gift from The Sharp Foundation brings our current fundraising total to </span>
      <span>$1,625,000. Please remember, this is a $7 million project, and we need the help of </span>
      <span>every NOVA family to make this dream turn into reality. Raising more money means </span>
      <span>a lower loan amount. So we continue to ask for your support and urge you to </span>
      <span>consider making a contribution to the campaign. Our goal of getting 100% </span>
      <span>participation from NOVA families has not changed. Please consider doing your part </span>
      <span>to propel us forward.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>We invite you to visit our campaign website,<a href="index.html">www.novastrong.org</a>, which contains </span>
      <span>information about the project, architectural renderings, and the positive impact it </span>
      <span>will have on our club and the Richmond community. Remember, NOVA is a </span>
      <span>nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, so your donation is tax deductible. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span>To make a pledge, please reach out to Ann McGee, NOVA’s Development Manager, at </span>

      <h4 class="featurette-heading">June 10, 2015</h4>
      <br>
      <span>Dear NOVA Family and Friends,</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Success often comes from the realm of ‘sounds crazy… might work.’ Five months ago, would you have believed </span>
      <span>that we would be approaching $1,000,000 in commitments in support of our pool expansion initiative? But that is </span>
      <span>exactly where we are, thanks to the dedication and generosity of the first contributors to our capital campaign.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Roughly 80 NOVA families, plus all 21 members of the coaching and office staff, have combined to raise over </span>
      <span>$825,000! It remains an incredible start, but we can’t turn this dream into a reality without your support. Help us get </span>
      <span>over the $1,000,000 level by making your pledge this week. You’ll be part of the Founders’ Club if your pledge is </span>
      <span>received by June 15th.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Please visit our campaign website, <a href="http://www.novastrong.org">www.novastrong.org</a>, which contains information about the project, architectural </span>
      <span>renderings, and the positive impact it will have on our club and the Richmond community. Remember, NOVA is a </span>
      <span>nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, so your donation is tax deductible. And, take advantage of some great donor </span>
      <span>benefits, such as reserved parking spaces at NOVA meets, waivers for annual fundraising and volunteering </span>
      <span>requirements, and private lessons with a NOVA coach!</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>To make a pledge, please reach out to Ann McGee, NOVA’s Development Manager, at 804.750.1183 or </span>

      <span>Dear NOVA Family and Friends,</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Let me start by thanking the NOVA families that have already made their pledge in support of our pool </span>
      <span>expansion. We are excited to announce that we have raised over $675,000 in the first few months of our </span>
      <span>capital campaign! This is thanks to the early support of some fifty NOVA families, including 100% </span>
      <span>participation from the board, plus commitments from all twenty-one coaches and staff members. But </span>
      <span>our goal is to also have 100% participation from our competitive team families, and <u>you still have time to </span>
      <span>join the Founders’ Club – our initial group of donors – if you turn in your pledge card by June 15th.</u></span><br>

      <span><b>Parent socials spread the news</b></span><br>
      <br>
      <span>We hope you had a chance to join us at one of our parent socials, which were held over the last month </span>
      <span>and designed as a way to share information about NOVA’s expansion and fundraising plans. We were </span>
      <span>pleased to see so many of you with an interest in learning more about the project and how to support it. </span>
      <span><u>We still have one more parent social scheduled for Sunday, May 31st from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Fox Hall Clubhouse. </u></span>
      <span>If you didn’t get a chance to attend one earlier, we invite you to join us on that date. Please </span>
      <span>RSVP to <a href="mailto:annmcgee@novaswim.org">annmcgee@novaswim.org</a> if you plan to attend.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span><b>Planning continues to move forward</b></span><br>
      <br>
      <span>The plan of development for the project for the site and building was approved unanimously by Henrico </span>
      <span>County this morning. We are still seeking approval for the landscape and lighting plans. We also </span>
      <span>continue to work with Moseley Architects to refine the design. A neighborhood meeting, sponsored by </span>
      <span>county supervisor Pat O’Bannon and NOVA, was held on May 21st to share information and gather </span>
      <span>feedback from nearby residents.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span><b>New website has all the latest news</b></span><br>
      <br>
      <span>To share news about the project on an ongoing basis, we have launched a new website, www.novastrong.org, </span>
      <span>which includes detailed information about the project, the positive impact it will have on our club and the Richmond </span>
      <span>community, reasons to give, and the benefits of doing so. We will update it regularly with news, plans and more, so </span>
      <span>check back often.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span><b><u>Now</u> is the time to make a gift</b></span><br>
      <br>
      <span>To break ground on the project we need to raise $2 million. Our finance committee will be visiting potential lenders </span>
      <span>again in July, and the larger our fundraising total at that time, the better. If you’ve already made a gift, we thank you </span>
      <span>again for your support. If not, we would like you to consider making your gift by June 15th. Our goal is to have 100% </span>
      <span>participation from our competitive team families.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>To make a pledge, please reach out to Ann McGee, NOVA’s Development Manager. She can discuss the options </span>
      <span>with you, including the benefits that are available to donors at certain levels. These benefits include things such as </span>
      <span>recognition, reserved parking spaces at NOVA meets, waivers for annual fundraising and volunteering </span>
      <span>requirements, private lessons with a NOVA coach, and various naming rights. NOVA is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) </span>
      <span>organization, so your donation is tax deductible (speak to your financial or tax advisor for more information). </span>
      <span>Pledges can be spread out over five years, and we will work with you to set up a pledge payment schedule if you </span>
      <span>wish. We can also accept gifts of securities. Ann can be reached at 804.750.1183 or <a href="mailto:annmcgee@novaswim.org">annmcgee@novaswim.org.</a></span>

      <br>
      <span>Dear NOVA Family and Friends,</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>We are excited about our parent socials which start this weekend.  Every family will be receiving an invitation and </span>
      <span>we want to share some information as we move forward.</span><br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>At each gathering you’ll hear more about the NOVA 'state of the union' plus status and timing of the </span>
          <span>expansion project.  There will be an opportunity to ask questions and talk to board members and the </span>
          <span>coaching staff.  We want you to know that you will not be under any pressure to make a financial </span>
          <span>commitment at the socials.  We really want you to come and learn more about NOVA’s future in a fun and relaxed setting!</span>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <span>Please take the time and RSVP.  People are kind to open up their homes and community centers and we </span>
          <span>need to know attendance for planning purposes.</span>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <span>When you RSVP, please let us know if you would like to attend another social on an alternative date if that </span>
          <span>is more convenient.  Socials are planned on the following evenings:  April 26th and 30th; May 3rd, 7th, 14th </span>
          <span>and 17th.  Just let Ann know what would work best -- we want to be as accommodating as possible.</span>

      <br>
      <span>Dear NOVA Family and Friends,</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>We’re pleased to report that our expansion plans are proceeding on all fronts!  The many folks involved in the </span>
      <span>project continue to be excited by what this opportunity means for the NOVA community.   With the addition of more </span>
      <span>water, all of our swimmers will benefit – whether through better practice times, less crowded lanes, more flexible </span>
      <span>swim lessons or dedicated long course training space.  Parents will benefit too, with reduced travel and more </span>
      <span>comfortable home meets.  In addition, more space will allow NOVA to increase the breadth of our offerings, </span>
      <span>introduce new programming, and add to our outreach programs.   Our impact will be dramatically amplified by increasing our capacity.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span><b>Design & Construction Plans Moving Ahead</b></span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Much is being done to prepare for building the new facility. The Board is working closely with Moseley Architects to </span>
      <span>submit our Plan of Development (POD) to the county next week. The POD includes the site plan and the building </span>
      <span>concept. The process of approval for the POD is five to six months; during this time, no site work can be done; </span>
      <span>however, we will continue to proceed with design work for the building and pool during this time.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>The Board of Directors has already authorized Moseley to complete the next set of designs on the project.  Once </span>
      <span>that is complete, the Board will reevaluate the budget based on our capital campaign results and make a decision </span>
      <span>on whether to move forward with the rest of the design work, which includes finalizing the design, creating the </span>
      <span>construction documents and selecting a contractor for the project.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span><b>Fundraising Continues</b></span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Our total for the capital campaign now stands at nearly $600,000, over a quarter of the project fundraising goal of $2 </span>
      <span>million.  While this is a great start, there is a long way to go to realize our dream of a 50 meter pool! The project </span>
      <span>requires the support of all NOVA families to succeed, and we hope that we can count on yours.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>We are excited to enter into the next phase of our capital campaign.   We are in the process of organizing group </span>
      <span>socials, many to be hosted personally by NOVA families, where we will be able to explain the details of our vision in </span>
      <span>a fun and relaxed setting.  These gatherings will begin in late April, and every NOVA family will receive an </span>
      <span>invitation.  Guest lists are based on summer swim team/address (to the best of our ability!).   At each gathering </span>
      <span>you’ll hear more about the status and timing of the project, and be able to ask questions and talk to board members </span>
      <span>and coaching staff about the project.  We hope that you will attend as it will give you a much better understanding of </span>
      <span>the project, why the project is important to our children and our community, and the crucial role that each of us plays </span>
      <span>in making the project a reality.     We can’t wait to share our enthusiasm about NOVA’s bright future!</span><br>
      <br>
      <span><b>What's Next?</b></span><br>
      <br>
      <span>While we are anxious to break ground, <b>this won’t happen without the financial support</b> of our NOVA families and </span>
      <span>friends. Our hope is that you will consider making a gift to support the project. NOVA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit </span>
      <span>organization, so gifts are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. Additionally, donors can choose to spread their </span>
      <span>pledges out over up to five years.  As an individual or corporate donor, you’ll receive various benefits for making a </span>
      <span>gift at certain levels, including waivers for fundraising and/or volunteer hours, preferred parking, and more. </span>
      <span>Contributions made by May 31, 2015 will be recognized as part of our Founders’ Club.  If you want to learn more, </span>
      <span>feel free to reach out to our Capital Campaign Steering Committee:  Turner Broughton, Faith Kallman, Andrea </span>

    <p>
      <h4 class="featurette-heading">February 25, 2015</h4>
      <br>
      <span>Dear NOVA Family and Friends,</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>First of all, thank you for choosing NOVA. We appreciate your being part of the NOVA family and for your </span>
      <span>commitment to swimming, whether it is through our competitive swim team, swim lessons, or adult programs.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Founded in 1987 with ninety swimmers utilizing rented pool space across the Richmond region, NOVA now offers a </span>
      <span>full-service aquatics program with close to 800 competitive swimmers, a lessons program that teaches some 5,000 </span>
      <span>lessons per year, a nationally-recognized Masters team, various programs to meet the needs of recreational </span>
      <span>swimmers, and the only local, full-service swim shop in the region.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>NOVA’s development over time has allowed it to broaden its programs and fulfill its mission – <i>to develop excellence </span>
      <span>in swimmers of all ages and abilities by challenging and motivating them to reach their full potential in swimming </span>
      <span>AND in life.</i> This progress has always been triggered by the expansion of our facilities. As we have increased </span>
      <span>capacity, we have expanded our offerings and our impact in the community.</span><br>
      <br> 
      <span>The dedication and commitment of the families, coaches and swimmers that came before us have always driven </span>
      <span>NOVA’s growth. Prior to 1997, NOVA practiced at three widely scattered facilities across Richmond. In 1997, </span>
      <span>NOVA’s families and coaches built NOVA its own facility, bringing our swimmers together under one roof. Less than </span>
      <span>ten years later the NOVA community pulled together once again when it became clear that we had outgrown our </span>
      <span>original pool, building our second pool in 2005.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Just as we were during those two critical periods, our current facility limits our ability to execute our mission. For the </span>
      <span>competitive team, this means crowded lanes, less than ideal practice times, and burdensome and expensive travel </span>
      <span>for our families. For our lessons program, we are turning interested swimmers away due to a lack of space. For our </span>
      <span>community, we are unable to offer extensive after school learn-to-swim programs for underprivileged children in our </span>
      <span>area, or to serve other groups, such as elderly clientele who would benefit from daily lap swimming or exercise programs.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>We are proud of how far NOVA has come and the success of our club. Our competitive team is currently ranked in </span>
      <span>the top ten nationally; and we consistently send swimmers to the Olympic Trials and to elite university swim </span>
      <span>programs. More importantly, NOVA offers our swimmers a positive, healthy experience that fosters lifelong </span>
      <span>friendships and teaches important life lessons.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>We have the opportunity to achieve even more: we have the focus, coaches and family support to get to a new level </span>
      <span>of service and impact. To achieve our goals, <b>NOVA plans to construct a new 50-meter indoor pool on our </span>
      <span>current campus.</b> We have hired Moseley Architects to design and help construct this important project. NOVA </span>
      <span>swimmers will be able to train in an Olympic-sized pool, and we will be able to offer additional lane space and </span>
      <span>practice times to all training groups. The addition of the 50-meter pool will enable NOVA to raise the temperature of </span>
      <span>the current competition pool to better facilitate swim lessons, introduce older adult wellness programs, and seek out </span>
      <span>sports medicine and rehabilitation partnerships with local organizations.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>As in the past, we count on the financial support of NOVA’s families and friends, as well as those businesses and </span>
      <span>organizations that support our mission. Funding for the new pool will come from three sources: (1) cash on hand; (2) </span>
      <span>borrowing; and, (3) individual and corporate donations. This is where you have a role to play.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>We would like to have the new pool open by the start of the short course season in the fall of 2016. However, we </span>
      <span>can only break ground if NOVA’s families are truly devoted to the project. To determine whether such a commitment </span>
      <span>exists, we began meeting with some NOVA families around the first of the year. In just 45 days, the families with </span>
      <span>whom we have met affirmed their commitment to make NOVA’s latest dream a reality, pledging over $525,000 </span>
      <span>toward the construction of a new pool, with most donations coming in at the $15,000 and $25,000 levels!</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>While this is an outstanding start, NOVA needs to raise $2,000,000 in individual and corporate contributions to </span>
      <span>move forward with the proposed expansion. We are confident that we can meet our goal, but doing so means that it </span>
      <span>is going to take all of us to make the new pool a reality. We have yet to speak to the overwhelming majority of </span>
      <span>NOVA families about the project, and we are anxious to do so over the next two months. In order to help tell the </span>
      <span>story we intend to hold parent education socials to provide details and answer questions, and to continue meeting </span>
      <span>with our many interested families. We will also be releasing a website in support of the 2015 campaign effort very soon.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Perhaps most importantly, we need to continue pressing forward towards our campaign goal. To that end, we are </span>
      <span>inviting all NOVA families to help us reach our fundraising target of $2,000,000. NOVA is a 501(c)(3) organization so </span>
      <span>contributions are tax deductible, and they can be spread out for up to a five-year period. The Board has approved </span>
      <span>the benefits that individuals will receive for their charitable contribution, including such things as a reserved parking </span>
      <span>space for meets, volunteer hour waivers, and private lessons with a NOVA coach.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>All contributors who make their pledge by April 30, 2015 will be recognized as part of NOVA’s Founders Club – </span>
      <span>those individuals and businesses that helped launch the project, and made it possible to pursue this dream of more </span>
      <span>water for our swimmers and our community.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Swimming changes lives. Stay tuned for more details about how you can help.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span>Best Regards,</span><br>
